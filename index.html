    <h1>Lyrics</h1>
    <p>Yo, VIP, let's kick it! <br>
    Ice ice baby <br>
    Ice ice baby <br>
    All right stop <br>
    Collaborate and listen <br>
    Ice is back with my brand new invention <br>
    Something grabs a hold of me tightly <br>
    Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly <br>
    Will it ever stop? <br>
    Yo, I don't know <br>
    Turn off the lights and I'll glow <br>
    To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal <br>
    Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle <br>
    Dance <br>
    Go rush the speaker that booms <br>
    I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom <br>
    Deadly, when I play a dope melody <br>
    Anything less than the best is a felony <br>
    Love it or leave it <br>
    You better gain way <br>
    You better hit bull's eye <br>
    The kid don't play <br>
    If there was a problem <br>
    Yo, I'll solve it <br>
    Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it <br>
    Ice ice baby Vanilla <br>
    Ice ice baby Vanilla <br>
    Ice ice baby Vanilla <br>
    Ice ice baby Vanilla <br>
    Now that the party is jumping <br>
    With the bass kicked in, and the Vegas are pumpin' <br>
    Quick to the point, to the point no faking <br>
    I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon <br>
    Burning 'em if, if you ain't quick and nimble <br>
    I go crazy when I hear a cymbal <br>
    And a hi hat with a souped up tempo <br>
    I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo <br>
    Rollin' in my 5.0 <br>
    With my ragtop down so my hair can blow <br>
    The girlies on standby <br>
    Waving just to say, "Hi" <br>
    Did you stop? <br>
    No, I just drove by <br>
    Kept on pursuing to the next stop <br>
    I bust a left and I'm heading to the next block <br>
    That block was dead <br>
    Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue <br>
    Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis <br>
    Rockman lovers driving Lamborghini <br>
    Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine <br>
    Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine <br>
    Ready for the chumps on the wall <br>
    The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight ball <br>
    Gunshots ranged out like a bell <br>
    I grabbed my nine <br>
    All I heard were shells <br>
    Fallin' on the concrete real fast <br>
    Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas <br>
    Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed <br>
    I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack <br>
    Police on the scene <br>
    You know what I mean? <br>
    They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends <br>
    If there was a problem <br>
    Yo, I'll solve it <br>
    Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it <br>
    Ice ice baby Vanilla <br>
    Ice ice baby Vanilla <br>
    Ice ice baby Vanilla <br>
    Ice ice baby Vanilla <br>
    Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet <br>
    Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it <br>
    My town, that created all the bass sound <br>
    Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground <br>
    'Cause my style's like a chemical spill <br>
    Feasible rhymes you can vision and feel <br>
    Conducted and formed <br>
    This is a hell of a concept <br>
    We make it hype and you want to step with this <br>
    Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja <br>
    Cut like a razor blade so fast <br>
    Other DJ's say, "Damn" <br>
    If my rhyme was a drug <br>
    I'd sell it by the gram <br>
    Keep my composure when it's time to get loose <br>
    Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice <br>
    If there was a problem <br>
    Yo, I'll solve it! <br>
    Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it <br>
    Ice ice baby Vanilla <br>
    Ice ice baby Vanilla <br>
    Ice ice baby Vanilla <br>
    Ice ice baby Vanilla <br>
    Yo man, let's get out of here <br>
    Word to your mother <br>
    Ice ice baby <br>
    Too cold <br>
    Ice ice baby <br>
    Too cold too cold <br>
    Ice ice baby <br>
    Too cold too cold <br>
    Ice ice baby <br>
    Too cold too cold <br>
